## ðŸ§± Clean Architecture Structure

This project follows the Clean Architecture pattern with the following layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains `entities`, `repositories` (abstract), and `use cases`.
- **Data Layer**: Implements `models`, `repositories`, and `datasources` for local/remote data.
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI and state management (Bloc).
- **Core**: Shared logic, error handling, and base classes like `UseCase`.

### ðŸ“Š Data Flow

1. UI calls a **Use Case** (e.g., `ViewProductUseCase`)
2. Use Case interacts with **Repository**
3. Repository fetches data from **Data Source** (e.g., API or local storage)
4. Result is passed back up to the UI

### âœ… Testing

- Unit tests for use cases, models, and repositories
- Mockito used for mocking dependencies
- Test files follow the same folder structure as the app code
